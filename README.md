Project : Customer Complaint Analysis and Sentiment Evaluation for Voucher Prediction - The objective of this project was to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse customer reviews for the German railway system, develop a predictive model to determine the eligibility of customers for goodwill vouchers based on their feedback, and generate automated email responses addressing their issues. The ultimate goal was to enhance customer satisfaction and ensure a smoother journey experience by efficiently resolving customer complaints and rewarding loyal customers.

This objective is clear and comprehensive, highlighting the key aspects of my project:

●	Leveraging NLP: Specifies the use of NLP techniques.

●	Analysing Customer Reviews: States the initial task of analysing the customer feedback data.

●	Keywords Extraction and calculating Sentiment Score: Keyword extraction using NLP (Natural Language Processing) involves identifying and extracting important words from customer reviews.

●	Predictive Model: Mentions the development of a model to predict voucher eligibility.

●	Automated Email Generation: Includes the task of generating emails based on customer issues.

●	Enhancing Customer Satisfaction: Emphasises the overarching goal of improving the customer experience.

●	Created a web application for customers to input their issues and receive guidance regarding their problems.

●	Utilised Streamlit to develop the web application, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface.

Model Integration:
●	Integrated all trained NLP models, including keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and classification models, into the web application.

●	Ensured that the application could effectively process customer input and provide appropriate directions and responses.
